### ABOUT

In Memory Bubble Store, players take on the role of a shop owner who sells origami toys sealed in delicate bubbles, each imbued with a powerful memory of childhood connections with nature. As players interact with these toys, they unlock the personal stories and early memories of characters who once found joy and comfort in nature. Through these experiences, players explore five key pathways to strengthen their bond with natureâ€”sensory contact, appreciating beauty, reflecting on meaning, forming emotional bonds, and showing care for the environment. These memories help ease eco-anxiety and boost mental health, fostering resilience and well-being by reconnecting players with nature.

The game features a nostalgic low-poly, early 2000s visual style, creating a calming atmosphere that enhances the emotional experience.

The theme of "bubble" symbolizes the delicate, fleeting nature of memories and the lightness and joy they bring, inviting players to reflect and heal in a safe, soothing environment. The bubble-shaped origami toys represent the fragile yet meaningful nature of these memories, which serve as catalysts for players to reconnect with the natural world.
